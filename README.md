# github_assignment

Deadline is Sep 15 11:59PM

1. Clone this repo “toy_assignment” from the “CUSP2022FallPUI” organization on your local machine. 

2. Open the ‘HW_github.ipynb’ file on jupyter notebook or google colab. You need to run the function ‘intro’ by passing your first name, last name and NYU net ID as arguments. (successful run should print ‘Welcome to PUI 2022 "first name" "last name". Your NYU id is "NYU net ID"’ as output).

3. Create a new branch in your homework repository. (Branches are important if you need to have a separate workflow in the project or if multiple people are working collaboratively on the same repo.)

4. Upload the homework jupyter notebook (with printed output) in the new branch created. Write ‘add HW with output’ as commit message.

5. Create a pull request to merge the new branch with the main branch. Review the changes and merge the pull request.
